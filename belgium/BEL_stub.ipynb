    "- An interesting aspect in the Belgian case is that Belgium has a famously aggressive way it counts Covid-19 deaths (see, e.g. here: https://www.newsweek.com/belgium-highest-covid-19-death-rate-1498021 ). This can be readily seen in the following graph published by Statbel, which shows that Covid-19 deaths per day are, from April 6th to 16th, equal to the total number of deaths per day, on average, for the period 2009-2018: https://www.newsweek.com/belgium-highest-covid-19-death-rate-1498021 "
