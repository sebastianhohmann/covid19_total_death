    "The data for England and Wales (as well as sub-regions, such as London) can be accessed from the Office of National Statistics here: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/weeklyprovisionalfiguresondeathsregisteredinenglandandwales\n",

    "Note that the ONS Covid deaths are slightly higher than those reported on GOV.UK here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-track-coronavirus-cases\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for using ONS counts for both is that both total deaths and covid-19 deaths are based on **date of registration** of the death. As we want to make apples-to-apples comparisons as far as possible, we are not using covid deaths from .GOV.UK.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formatting of the ONS data as they are distributed is somewhat inconvenient, which is why we have to process them first. You can skip this step and directly work with the processed files, which can be found in `../uk/data/processed`.\n",

    "\n",
    "- ONS also publishes, for Covid-19 only, a series of daily and weekly **occurrences** of death. This would be preferable to use for our purposes (since it is based on the date the death actually happened). It is only available, however, for Covid-19 and not for total deaths. To make apples-to-apples comparisons, **we are using registered, not occurred deaths**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- One worry with this approach could be that registration delay may be especially severe during times such as Covid-19 when the administrative system can become overwhelmed. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A slightly distinct worry would be if Covid-19 deaths and other deaths suffer from differential degree of registration delay. \n",
    "\n",
    "- As we do in other places, we therefore repeat our plea to **interpret our results with caution**."
